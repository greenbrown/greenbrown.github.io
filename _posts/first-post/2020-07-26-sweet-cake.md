> <h2> why just why. </h2>

Whenever you feel bad after saying wrong things to someone, throwing **_`general apologize`_** does not fix that. For sure, hell no. It's more obviously, you just let other people to see how worst you are behind that fake --good boi [which always do introspection and picky wording person]-- mask. I would say even worst compare with the one which not do any apologize.

So, you mean better NOT to apologize at all? Of course, **_`you better do that!`_**. It's more for your own sake. First, because you got rid off your overthinking immediately. Exactly.

I use laugh word expression or emoticon a lot in chat. A LOT. Most of the time I mean every `wkwk` or `hahaha` in real world while sending it in chat. I think that's why I put it in the chat, not just as _*garnish*_ to make myself sounds li(k)e a funny or easy-going person. It should be other confirmed those things in us :)

A little sweet pie: This kind of apologize does bother me. Will I let them know they should apologize in public by mentioning the person who deserve it also in person? Um, no haha.
